export const DEFAULT_STORY = `Once upon a time, in a whimsical forest, lived a tiny squirrel named Squeaky. Squeaky loved collecting shiny acorns. Every morning, he would set out with his little basket, his bushy tail twitching with excitement.

One sunny day, Squeaky discovered a magnificent oak tree, its branches reaching high into the sky. It was covered in the most enormous, golden acorns he had ever seen! He knew he had to gather as many as he could.

As he was busily collecting, a gentle breeze whispered through the leaves, carrying a sweet, melodious tune. Squeaky paused, captivated. He had never heard such beautiful music before.

Following the sound, Squeaky found a hidden glade where a wise old owl named Hoot was playing a flute made of a hollow reed. Hoot smiled and invited Squeaky to listen.

Squeaky spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying Hoot's music, forgetting all about his acorns. He realized that sometimes, the greatest treasures are not things you can collect, but moments of joy shared with new friends.`;
